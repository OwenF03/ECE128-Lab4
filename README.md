## Description

Design and test a car safety module on a Basys 3 FPGA, using switches as sensor inputs and leds as output signals. The description for the design can be found in the lab report. The design was implemented and tested using AMD Vivado 2023.1.

## Instructions to run

Download all of the provided files and create a new project using AMD Vivado 2023.1. Add Car_Safety.v and defs.v as design sources, Basys-3-Master.xdc as a constraint file, and testbench.v as a simulation source. Select the Xilinx Artic-7 FPGA (XC7A35T-ICPG236C) as the board. Ensure that Display.v is selected as the top module for design sources, and testbench.v is selected as the top module for simulation sources.
